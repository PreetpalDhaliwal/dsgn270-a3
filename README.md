- My design concept is for a water company, with an aqua, fresh, springy vibe. The companys name is Arctic Points. I thought of that name just because of how beatiful the arctic ocean looks and feels. For me the ocean water honestly looks delicious, yet I cannot drink it. This assignement was particularly difficult becuase the majority of my classmates were also struggling. Overal, I believe we understood the assignement in the end; it just took a little white to get the hang of it all.

## Below is a image of my how my svg logo looks in figma.
